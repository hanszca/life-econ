Improving economic conditions, reducing pollution, and enhancing human development factors can positively impact life expectancy.

The following data was pulled from Kaggle. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between life expectancy and socio-economic factors.

From the plots, we can draw the following conclusions about the relationships between life expectancy and socio-economic factors:

CO2 Production: There is likely a complex relationship between CO2 production and life expectancy. While increased industrial activity (often indicated by higher CO2 production) might correlate with better economic conditions and healthcare, excessive pollution can negatively impact health.

Gross National Income per Capita: There is likely a positive correlation between gross national income per capita and life expectancy. Higher income per capita is associated with better healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, leading to higher life expectancy.

Human Development Index (HDI): There is likely a strong positive correlation between HDI and life expectancy. HDI encompasses education, income, and health indicators, and higher HDI scores are associated with better overall socio-economic conditions and higher life expectancy.
